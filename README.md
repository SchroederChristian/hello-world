# hello-world
This is to test my skills at building a repository, and learning github!
I have succesfully created a new branch and am editing it as we speak.

About me,
My name is Christian Schroeder, I am 19 years old and I want to do something amazing with my life. We'll see how that goes as time moves forward.
